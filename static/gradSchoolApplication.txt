Recommendation Letter preparation algorithm:
1) No of reccos per prof/boss  = No of colleges u will end up applying
    The recco should be printed on a paper with the school/dept/office letterhead
    The recco should be dated properly, and should have all the details of the person who is giving it...like phone number, email id, his office address...his home address (if required)...his designation etc...
2) Its good to make reccos specific to each uni...like addressing the recco to the admission office/dept head or program director...
3) Print the material on a normal A4 paper...and try to keep ur recco to one page (one sided)
4) Then after the recco has been signed and sealed by the person who is giving it...fold it and put it in an envelope...seal all sides...
5) Then stamp the seal (of the person giving it) on the closed side of the envelope...and ask the person to cross sign it...
6] Use normal white envelopes. (letterhead envelopes if possible)
