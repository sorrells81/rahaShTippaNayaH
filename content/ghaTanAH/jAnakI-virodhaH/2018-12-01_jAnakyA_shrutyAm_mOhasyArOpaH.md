## विवरणम्
mAtAmhyai atra tatra gantum anumatim dehi, bahu smother na kuru iti ahaM mama mAtre uktavati. (sA 5 min dUraM api athitum na avakAsham dadAti tasya mAtre). 
athaH "tvam mouni bhava, ahaM jAnAmi kim karaNIyam" iti uktavati. 
"tvam bahu controlling asi, sarvAn api niyantrayitum icchasi" iti aham uktavati.

(श्रुतिटिप्पनीः -
** lets bury the hatchet does not really work. as long as the energy underneath it is not extinguished, mere words wont stop the flow of bad emotions on both sides. 
** reason does not apply here at all. there is no way i can convince them that (1) my opinion is my own (2) vishvas was misunderstood and not that harsh, he never told me to leave the marriage (3) my children will be brought up 100 times better than their children were. 
)

tadA sA:
- mama, tava pituh upari idAnIm tubhyam atyantaM "hatred" asti. pita api Evam Eva chintayati. 
(श्रुतिटिप्पनीः -
maybe true. because of what they did to my marriage, and the negative opinions they hold about my husband which they are not willing to change even when explained/reasoned. but are they taking all slight objections from me as a sign of hatred? 
)

- kathaM chit saH tubhyaM "hypnotize" krutavAn, tava manaH sampUrNateya parivartanaM abhavat. 

(श्रुतिटिप्पनीः -
he didnt hypnotize me, I agreed with his viewpoint. i am very happy with my changed self, and to be on the same page as him. i think it is a noble path.  
)

- jan mAsE api Evam nAsi. idAnIm tathA asi. you are very different from the shruthi we brought up. completely changed. 
(श्रुतिटिप्पनीः -
i am very happy with my changed self. they cannot accept it, too bad for them.
)

- do your own independent thinking, for heavens sake. you are completely influenced and controlled by your husband.
(श्रुतिटिप्पनीः -
they are jealous that i am siding with my husband, instead of their shallow selves. they want to play one against another, and separate the two of us ideologically. that is not going to happen. 
)

- nyUnAti nyUnam tava shishubhyAm viShaye tvaM svasyA chintanaM rakshasva, tad tava prime responsibility asti. 

(श्रुतिटिप्पनीः -
my children will be brought up 100 times better than her children were. 
)
- prathamam vayaM tatra na aagantum shaknumaha, nantaraM idAnIm tava putra api naa agantum shaknoti. paschAt eka kAlam aagacchati yadA tvaM api atra na aagacchasi.

(श्रुतिटिप्पनीः -
if a place leaves me feeling miserable, i have every right to maintain my sanity and avoid it. i think this is emotional blackmail. 
)

- aham kimchit breakdown krutvA "idAnIm mam 8th month, mahyaM prashAnta manah (samichInam state of mind) maintain karaNIyam, paryAptaM etat" iti uktavati. 
- "tad tu tava haste asti" iti uktavati, sarvaM garbage uktvA. 

(श्रुतिटिप्पनीः -
yes i take responsibility for my emotions and certainly wont leave it in the hands of chandAlAs like you.
i have very little respect for such people who pretend to be uber-helpful and then dump all their negativity on you and tell you to manage it.  
)

पुनः श्रुतिः - "sA kEvalaM phone madhye bhAshamANa, shunakEna saha samayaM vyApayati. mAm completely avoid karoti. mahyaM tad samyak Eva, speaking will be more toxic"

विश्वासः - त्वं किमर्थं ताम् उपदेष्टुम् अगच्छस् तन्मातृविषये? 
श्रुतिः - "hmmm tad mama dOshaH. yad kimapi vadAmi tad "hatred" bhavati. maybe i can be dharma-prajnA without insulting their path (but knowing their path is sub-optimal, less fitter than mine, but allowing them to follow it as they are not capable of doing better). maybe that is all is needed. show compassion (ayyo-paavo) "
विश्वासः - "etadapi samiichiinam - laghubaalais saha yathaa tathaa vartanam. but तेषान् त्वय्य् अधार्मिकाग्रहेषु सीमास्थापने च निष्ठुरयैव भाव्यम्. मम सुप्रत्ययस्य चोदाहरणं ग्राह्यम्। "

विश्वासेनैषस् सम्वादः स्वपरिवारजनेभ्यो दर्शितः - "For your kind information only, not for further discussion or forwarding. (rAmAyaNa round 50 black and white from shruti's perspective) - भविष्ये ऽस्मिन् विषये युष्माकम् भ्रमो मास्त्विति।" इति ।
