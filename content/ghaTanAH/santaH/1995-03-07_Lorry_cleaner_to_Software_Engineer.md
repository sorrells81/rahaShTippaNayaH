Raju had started his life as a lorry cleaner in Andhra. He had not gone beyond middle school. He had been married and had two children. He was in his 30s when one day the lorry driver assaulted him. Raju was terribly upset and searched for another job. He got one in a local polytechnic college where he would clean burettes and pipettes in the lab. The principal one day offered him an additional assignment. He was to deposit the checks in the bank every day, wait till they entered those into the computer, and return with the receipts. Raju eagerly took it up because he could earn additional three hours of overtime every day. He was fascinated by the computer he saw at the bank. He would keep staring at it in awe. The manager who ran the EDP department was a very nice person. He asked Raju to remain seated in the airconditioned room while the checks were entered and tallied. This was a luxury in the sweltering heat of Andhra. The manager noticed Raju’s fascination with computers. One day he asked him, “Do you want to learn computers?” Raju answered in the affirmative. The manager started teaching him the basics. Those must have been the wonderful days before the data privacy paranoia set in! A few months later, they were hiring a temporary peon in the EDP department. Raju got hired. Now, he could help others with computer operations all day long. The manager taught him programming. Raju was a quick learner. He had become a very good programmer in a few years. ,.,
