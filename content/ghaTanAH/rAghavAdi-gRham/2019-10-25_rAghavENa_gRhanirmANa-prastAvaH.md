## उत्तमप्रकोष्ठप्रस्तावः
आदौ 2019-10-25 इति दिने - "Hi Vishvas, Can you get the terrace room key while coming today? Need some quiet space to take calls since I will be working from home on Thursdays."

परेद्युर् नागरत्नावासुकिभ्याम् मिलितम्। नागरत्ना स्पष्टं नियमान् अवदत्। राघवेनाङ्गीकृता नियमाः।

## patio-निर्माणप्रस्तावः
आदौ राघवः प्रस्तावम् अकरोत् - "raise tank, solar water heaters above a steel frame structure and use more of the terrace as a patio" इति। विश्वासो मातरम् पृष्ट्वावदत् - "That is a reasonable solution for the solar water heater problem. Amma confirms she will be fine if you employ a good structural engineer to design the steel frame and execute it as he says. PS: Note that the foundation does not extend over the sump (a beam supports the upper structure there) - be sure the let him know that as well. They shouldn't start work unless you get a the design from the structural engineer and show it to us as well. Please don't skimp on it - shouldn't cost more than 5k or 10k in consultation (my guess)."। 

## गृहनिर्माणप्रस्तावः
ततो राघवस् तु कस्यचन गृहस्य भूमानम् अदर्शयत्। विश्वासोऽवदत् - "rAghava, if you are now suggesting that you will build this structure to cover our terrace: amma is NOT ok with it - since it will complicate future property division and settlement."। राघवस् तु - "I thought that plan was scrapped. Since they were planning to come back here." इति। विश्वासः - "It is a plan and plans can change (whether it is in a year or a decade). In any case, irrespective of whether amma plans to come and stay, this will be a complicating factor. Also, I am not sure where your appa's plans will head (which is one thing I wanted to mention considering your heavy investment, but forgot.)" इत्य् अवदत्। वासुकिर् मातुलो ऽस्मिन् वाट्साप्धारायां योजितः, किन्तु तूष्णीं निरगच्छत्।
