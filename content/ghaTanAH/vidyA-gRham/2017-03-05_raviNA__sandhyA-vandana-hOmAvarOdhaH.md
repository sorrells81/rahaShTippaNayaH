+++([8:50 AM, 3/6/2017] Ravi:)+++ Vishvas, you are welcome to come and stay with us. Under the current circumstances, and sentiments here, we will have to keep any rituals inside the confines of the house. That means no homa or sandhyavandane in the backyard, but can be done inside. Hope that won't be a problem and not make you decide against the visit  
+++([8:54 AM, 3/6/2017] Ravi:)+++ With many threats and a shooting we all can't be too careful to ensure safety  
+++([9:08 AM, 3/6/2017] Vishvas:)+++ @Ravi  - Thanks for laying it out. Forethought is good.  

I understand that it would be a security risk to you and others if you were to accompany me while I wear a dhoti or tilaka (as I've done everyday for a while now). That can be solved by - simply - not accompanying me where I go. But this backyard thing doesn't seem rational to me at all - the only people who can peek inside are your neighbors, who already know that you're Indian. If we cannot be too careful, the next idea might be to apply make-up to look white. Let me know if you will reconsider.

+++([10:23 AM, 3/6/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Hi guys I am trying to get this man's total hip replacement crowd funded. Right to live is raising funds for the same. It will be great if you can spread the word. Details could be obtained from this link  
https://www.righttolive.org/program/help-gopinath-get-hip-surgery  
+++([10:23 AM, 3/6/2017] Vishvas:)+++ My high school classmate - a doctor at vasavi - is trying to raise funds for a patient. Pls do fwd and contribute if possible.  
+++([10:23 AM, 3/6/2017] Vishvas:)+++ (Message from acquaintance Rthvik.)  
+++([10:46 AM, 3/6/2017] Ravi:)+++ Vishvas, I want to take this time to explain a bit this time, but it's not always possible and I really hope this helps to clarify. I could have called instead, but it's not always possible to make my point clear in quick phone calls. I have no business judging how you live and vice versa. For us, family safety is top priority and we are not taking any chances. There is widespread xenophobia and our neighbors won't always ask us about what we practice to understand it. We are already pained in circumstances when our kids think they don't fit in or feel discriminated. We don't want their hard earned friends in the neighborhood thinking they don't fit in even more. While I have respect for what you practice, I want to be very clear that I give no opportunity to what I believe goes towards asking for trouble in the current state. I would not want to ask you to stop wearing dhoti or shave your shikha as I think that's disrespectful, but would like for you to be sensitive and respectful of how we live and our sentiments when you are here. Your make-up remark is disrespectful in taste and I am in no mood for ridicule. It's not a big deal, but I am in no mood for more such ridicule or long arguments. If this point is not clear or some how makes you feel is hurting your ego in some sense, we can talk this evening, as I have no intention of that. Safety first, and we like having you here as long as you respect that as well.  
+++([11:03 AM, 3/6/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Your and your daughters' safety (from your perspective, which is different from mine) was at the top of my mind while writing my response as well. I was very practical about my noting that my dhoti etc.. might (from your perspective, which is different from mine) jeopardize your safety. If so, not accompanying me (and me checking my back to make sure that I am not being followed while returning home) is a fair solution. It doesn't hurt or shock me in any way. I am more than fine by myself. No ridicule was intended there.  

While I can compromise by planning in this way to ensure safety, I don't care to change my habits to save prajJNA's "hard earned friends" who might not like how I look, or to make them or you feel that they/ you "fit in" more, or to keep your neighbors from judging you by my company. If that's a higher priority, good for you, I'll stay away. "Safety first" is fine, not this stuff.  

Furthermore, I don't understand how I would be being insensitive to how you live or your sentiments in the context of your discussion - unless of course you mean the preceding paragraph. Please clarify.  

"Your make-up remark is disrespectful in taste and I am in no mood for ridicule." - Again, the idea here was to think logically, you may feel free to put aside any disrespect and look at it as a way of putting your idea in the spectrum of possible ideas.  

"I could have called instead, but it's not always possible to make my point clear in quick phone calls" ‚Üí I agree, and have no issues with this mode of talking - I agree that this is better in some cases. You may continue with written responses, if you like - no pressure, Seattle trip is no big deal for me.  
+++([11:11 AM, 3/6/2017] Ravi:)+++ If I had a problem with you being around us looking the way you do, I would have told you so. The point is to keep rituals indoors. I don't need to explain myself more. It's really up to you  
+++([11:13 AM, 3/6/2017] Vishvas:)+++ I am not interested in keeping rituals indoors without any reasonable explanation just because you command so. Up to me.  
+++([11:23 AM, 3/6/2017] Ravi:)+++ I have already written long paragraph during my work hours but you don't seem to be interested in seeing the point in it. If you are truly interested we can chat more. But if this is just to say that you want to have it your way, my üôè

+++([6:47 PM, 3/6/2017] Ravi:)+++ Vidya said she could not open the saveamericanitjobs link I had earlier shared. Here is a buzzfeeds commentary on it. Recommend reading it https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/anti-immigration-website-stokes-fear-among-indian-tech-worke?utm_term=.efDZNOw1y#.htoWXLZMy  
+++([6:23 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ This happened in San Jose..http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indian-man-harassed-verbally-san-jose-racism-us/1/898516.html  
+++([7:22 AM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ These reports are a good idea - please feel free to keep them coming. Some observations to put things in perspective:  

* For the most part there is no reason for any alarm if you agree that north Indians in bengaLUru feel safe enough. This go-home business is not much different from the type of feedback north Indians living in bengaLUru occasionally get  (and perhaps milder than that).  
* Burglaries and vandalism targetting Indians in particular is nothing new (my previous car's seller told me how white kids in his locality specifically vandalized Indian cars including his). Same with verbal taunts. I've had such rare experiences in massachussetts and here in the Obama years. Just as northies in the south face. It is not unexpected, and not difficult to ignore. The commentary in the YouTube video of Indian families is nothing surprising.   
* Overall, the uptick is not big enough to go crazy. Plot from the hatemap wesbite shows that the hate orgs have not reached 2011 levels. Many of the new ones particularly target muslims. The telugu guy was shot because they confused him with a muzzie. So, if you distinguish yourself from muslims, you are in fact safer.  
* The news from Houston indicates that that particular locality is unsafe for Indians. There have always been such localities, this joins the list.  
* Anyone can (still) come to major american cities and resorts and expect to have a very good time - people are kind for the most part. I feel perfectly comfortable never locking the door when I am inside (even at night) and wandering about as I like in Mountain view.  
+++([8:19 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ These arguments seem flawed or self serving. North Indians don't have a different skin color. And Bengalurians don't have guns in almost every house hold and indian constitution doesn't give them the right to bear arms. 9/11 hate was against muslims current american crisis is about jobs. Hate groups are against job stealing not about religion. I came to this country a week after 9/11 and lived in Mountain view. I felt my coworkers were not welcoming but had no safety issues. I have now met my colleagues who were harassed by what I believed was an extremely safe Bellevue square mall. It makes no sense to be counting the number of hate groups from 9/11. We never locked our door here and the guy in Kent perhaps was also not locking his door until he got shot. I bet his household now does.  
+++([8:20 AM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Also, speaking from my experience of hitchhiking to and from the ski slopes, using local buses, asking for jump starts : local whites tend to be far more kind and helpful than Indians - particularly the well-off and born-here kind. (airbnb stays concur with this, though I haven't interacted with Indian boarders there.)  
+++([8:32 AM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Sure, the north Indian case is not identical (nor was it claimed to be) - many of them can pass off as locals - until they open their mouth. So one has the option of keeping shut. And given the right to bear arms, it is correct that the consequences of intolerance towards migrants is more severe here.  

Still, operating under the supposition that hate shootings are quite rare and can be ignored from the perspective of daily life (true from my perspective), one can safely say that the "verbal harassment" stuff is more or less equivalent (I'd say less) compared to naarthies in bengaLuru - and not a big deal.  
+++([8:45 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ That means nothing. Have you stopped wearing seat belt counting how many Indian drivers don't wear them?  
+++([9:48 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ To each his own. Everybody can react to these incidents in his own way. No point debating or rationalizing it, since it is a very subjective matter.  
+++([9:49 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ Links are shared here for awareness. Read/assimilate/excrete.  
+++([9:54 AM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ +1 no objections to sharing links.  
+++([9:56 AM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ No - because:  
* Wearing seatbelts is objectively significantly safer at highway speeds and even less.  
* It is against the law not to wear seatbelts.  

Not so with stuff like "don't do your vodoo in the yard, don't trust your neighbors" stuff.  
+++([9:58 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ Trust is subjective. You can trust everybody until trust fails you. Or you can trust nobody until you somebody wins your trust somehow. No discussing this either.  
+++([9:58 AM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Whether there is a point debating or rationalizing it, of course, depends on the quality of the debaters and the audience. In this case, it is not "not worth it".  
+++([10:03 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ Our (very difference l different) experiences make us the person we are, make us form opinions the way we do. Explaining everything is futile here. We just have to respect everybody's opinions and let them be.  
+++([10:15 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ Now you are arguing for the sake of it.  If you really are not, try to remember you shouting "seat belt seat belt" for all the passengers and "helmet helmet" for all the pillion 2 wheeler riders. Or having a guard for every possible part of your body while you snowboard. There are no laws against them. And yes, there are laws against attacking or abusing someone. If Sanjose police was adequately staffed the culprit would have been arrested. Perhaps you were never shouted at, I was - a bunch of drunks surrounded me in Reno and shouted "hey Osama, don't blow up this casino". You might go looking for such things, perhaps might even preach them how indians are different and even more superior race not just to Osama's but to those shouting at you. But that's way out of my safety limit.  
+++([10:24 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ Different experiences, different reactions. Nobody here needs to know how every body else is dealing with life in the US. Who is being cautious, who isn't threatened, who locks all doors, who does not, etc.  
+++([10:24 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ BTW here is what I fear our neighbors will do for your backyard voodoo https://www.dhs.gov/how-do-i/report-suspicious-activity  
+++([10:26 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ https://www.seattle.gov/police/need-help/reporting-suspicious-behavior  
+++([10:27 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ If you have been living under a rock, you can look up instances of how police have reacted with suspects if you are thinking they will have the patience to be educated by you about what you are doing  
+++([10:29 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ Good thing they you don't have nosy neighbors in mountain view.  
+++([10:29 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ all this guy was doing was looking at garages as he walked on side walks http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/indian-man-partially-paralyzed-after-police-encounter-refiles-suit-against-n639351  
+++([10:29 AM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Firstly, I am not arguing at all. I know that it is a futile exercise as far as you and I are concerned. You are presenting your views, and I mine.  

"And yes, there are laws against attacking or abusing someone. If Sanjose police was adequately staffed the culprit would have been arrested." ‚Üí False, that is freedom of expression, no threat was made. You regularly see mad men shouting nonsense in castro street fairs.  

"Perhaps you were never shouted at, I was - a bunch of drunks surrounded me in Reno and shouted "hey Osama, don't blow up this casino"." ‚Üí yeah, I've had a drunk accost me and shruti as we returned home with some nonsense while returning to my elmwood street home in Austin. And I've had other jolts (massachussetts and Mountain view). So, it is not like you have all the negative experiences and I the positive ones.   

"BTW here is what I fear our neighbors will do for your backyard voodoo https://www.dhs.gov/how-do-i/report-suspicious-activity " - Yeah I have no sympathy there. In all my airbnb stays I did the vodoo in back and front yards -  I had no trouble whatsoever and in fact have only positive recommendations to show for it. And even if they report suspicious activity, that's all right as well as far as I am concerned - such suspicion may be investigated and found to be naught. It is further incredible given that I regularly do "voddoo" in my front yard, in a far more densely populated apartment context, who can (and do) see what I do.  

"If you have been living under a rock, you can look up instances of how police have reacted with suspects if you are thinking they will have the patience to be educated by you about what you are doing" ‚Üí Not that I am living under a rock, I am not interested in hiding under a rock.  
+++([10:30 AM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ "all this guy was doing was looking at garages as he walked on side walks http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/indian-man-partially-paralyzed-after-police-encounter-refiles-suit-against-n639351 "  ‚Üí Good example for how this stuff is not new.  
+++([10:32 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ Yes, nothing has changed per you, Vishvas. And a lot has changed from how Ravi sees it. These are perspectives, and you cannot rationalize them.  
+++([10:32 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ Seriously? That's example of police brutality. This surely is futile!  
+++([10:34 AM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Of course, that is police brutality. What's new in darker skinned people being harassed more in American society?  
+++([10:36 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ No point being made here. You can advice somebody to be more cautious or to take it easy because from what you see, not much has changed. You cannot argue to make anybody change their stance.  
+++([10:37 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ So, let's just dismiss it? Or when something like that happens you let your indian visitors know, that it's not OK to be peeking into others garages, you insist they carry id or some way to reach you, so that they don't break their spine by police  
+++([10:39 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ We tell people about how we think they can stay out of difficult situations.  
+++([10:43 AM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ No threat made? Freedom of expression? Then why was the guy calling 911?  
+++([10:45 AM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ Let's not waste our breath on this, and later regret for wasting time in an unproductive way  
+++([2:19 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ The guy does not know the law, and spooked about escalation? I suppose you actually read the article which explains the guy's version of what was said?  
+++([2:20 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ don't worry vidya. just light banter. relax.  
+++([2:22 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ No, don't dismiss this - fight it etc.. And warn Indian visitors as you say.  

Still bears no relation why they would break (say) my spine if your German origin neighbor (leaving aside the pAki and mid east folks) reported suspicious behavior to police and they came to check it out.  
+++([2:24 PM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ Police coming to verify the suspicious activity is inconvenience better avoided  
+++([2:25 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Coconut falling on your head is an inconvenience better avoided. Let us hence forth go out in full armor.  
+++([2:27 PM, 3/7/2017] Vidya:)+++ Not the same.  
+++([6:05 PM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ We don't want that inconvenience actually!  
+++([6:43 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Well, in certain fantasy worlds, such an inconvenience has a high enough probability of coming to pass, I see! Well then, it is not (and never was) a question of safety, but one of "convenience" and "image".  
+++([6:45 PM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ üòÄ hence proved!  
+++([6:45 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Yup. Reductio ad absurdium. Oldest trick in the book.  
+++([6:54 PM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ You should teach that to all the black and brown guys getting shot  
+++([6:54 PM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ Perhaps they can use it against the shooters  
+++([6:55 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Oh yes, I should tell them not to do sandhyavandana in the backyard of a certain Indian guy surrounded by Pakistani, German and MidEast neighbors in sammamish.  
+++([6:55 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ May be you have a point, it's more worth their while to be wary of fellow brownies.  
+++([6:56 PM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ The guy got shot for doing much less in kent  
+++([6:56 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ The guy who got shot in kent was shot for being who he is, not for doing anything special.  
+++([7:23 PM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ Our neighbors are all Americans.  
+++([7:26 PM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ The guy you call German will probably kill you if you insisted that with him.  
+++([7:26 PM, 3/7/2017] Ravi:)+++ His mom was German  
+++([7:30 PM, 3/7/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Ah, you speak of their citizenship on paper, rather than nationality. Interesting trick.  

As to German-birthed American, who ate my mom's food and lends you tools, if I were close by, I would gladly do the test and have a good laugh at your failed prediction. But atleast I should play that scene out only in my fantasy.

+++([9:36 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ While I was on paternity leave there used to be cars that come and stop in our cul-de-sac for a while and keep making rounds. Our neighborhood groups have talked about such activities a lot as well.  
+++([9:36 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ It's possible that they are real estate assessors.. it's also possible they are snoopers  
+++([9:51 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ The trump red cap has become a common scene in most joints  
+++([9:55 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ We don't have to go far to get into trouble  
+++([9:56 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ It's best to stay out of it  
+++([10:14 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ hmm.. That's odd.   

Trump is definitely a "go back to your country" type, no doubt about that. But I don't think that he is not the type who as a neighbor would interfere with whatever "voodoo" goes on in a neighbor's backyard.  
+++([10:15 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ While I am not "hard core", as someone who cares more about safety and security of India and the world more than the interests of Indians wishing to live and work in USA, I am glad that the Americans chose Trump over Shillary.  
+++([10:16 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ Double negative in last sentence not intentional.  
+++([10:16 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ I don't think that's the case. It is just that it does not matter from their perspective.  
+++([10:21 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ In the ideal case, someone like Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii will lead USA. But I doubt that the anglospheric core will let that happen.  
+++([10:25 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ This was always the case. A CS graduate cannot do OPT delivering pizzas.  
+++([10:26 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ Infosys Wipro cannot employ OPTs  
+++([10:26 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ They could before  
+++([10:27 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ That's certainly strange - why would they not be able to provide Optional Practical Trainings, I wonder.  
+++([10:29 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ The idea is that they are body shops for American companies  
+++([10:31 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ The authorities cannot exclude them unless they are really violating the law. I wonder if this hold true for all companies in the outsourcing business, or if Wipro is being specifically punished for some violation.  
+++([10:32 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ No all outsourcing companies  
+++([10:32 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ Not just the violaters  
+++([10:34 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ How sure are you about this?  
+++([10:34 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ Heard from someone affected  
+++([11:24 AM, 3/8/2017] Ravi:)+++ Tulsi is an actual possibility for 2020. I think this racism agenda cannot last longer than 4 years. People would want her more then than another white.  
+++([11:26 AM, 3/8/2017] Vishvas:)+++ I misspoke earlier. It is not exactly the anglospheric interests that will fight her, it is the christian interest. They will fight tooth and nail, and I suspect that they will succeed.
