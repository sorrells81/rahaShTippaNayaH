## विवरणम्
आगमनात् पूर्वं‌ विश्वासः सिद्धतां कल्पयितुम्-
...
Immigration officer: You were here just 4 months ago. Why come back so soon?
Amma: Because I expect my 4th american grandchild to be born this month, and want to spend some happy days with my grandchildren. Furthermore, I don't expect to be back for quite some time since my son's family plans to return to India.
Immigration officer: What does your son do?
Amma: He used to be an engineer at Google, but is now a stay-at-home dad - my daughter in law is a researcher at UCSF.

पूर्वं मातुर् एवम् प्रयाणावधय आसन् - 2018-02-14 - 2018-08-01, 2017-01-16 - 2017-07-10, 2015-12-01 - 2016-05-26, येष्वादिमवारं विद्यागृहं हि गतं तया। अस्मिन् पर्याये यदागता, एवं संवृत्तम् -
Vishvas was waiting at the arrival gate for a long time.

CBP officer (asian man): "Purpose of visit?"
nagarathna: "Visiting son."
CBP officer (asian man): What's your occupation?
Nagarathna: Retired.
CBP officer (asian man): "Show me return ticket"
Then asked a security person to escort Nagarathna to a room where there were many people waiting (including quite a few Indians). There :

CBP officer (White lady with accented English): "How many months are there in a year?"
Nagarathna: "12"
CBP officer lady: What is your country of residence?
Nagarthna: India
CBP officer lady: You're spending more time here than in India. I give you two options - go home right now or return by Jan 15.
Nagarathna refused to pick an option.
CBP officer generally refused to allow any interruptions: "Just answer my question. Don't waste my time."
CBP officer lady: What does your son do?
CBP officer lady: As what?

CBP officer lady: Ok - give me your son's phone number

CBP officer lady takes Shruthi's number calls Shruthi, asks for Vishvas - Shruthi says he's away, please call after 5 min. Meantime Vishvas calls CBP number and is told "possible problem -visit too frequent, long visit duration. you might get a call again. go upstairs and speak to the airlines - they can send someone inside and tell them you're waiting. " shruti called them and gave them my (now reactivated) number. vidya called them and reported: "The person who answered the phone was just about to call the immigration officer to give vishvas's phone number. I asked her to give him my phone number as well"

CBP officer lady calls Vishvas: "How are you? Expecting someone?"
Vishvas: Fine, how are you? expecting mother.
CBP officer lady: Purpose of visit? She's working.
Vishvas: Just want to be with each other. No not working.
CBP officer lady: Who wants to meet - you or her?
Vishvas: Both.
CBP officer lady: "How long have you been here?"
Vishvas: "Since 2007 Aug."
CBP officer lady: "Did she visit you in 2011?"
Vishvas: "Don't recall - might be 2010 or 11. Yes, she spent a few days with me in Austin. My sister is also here..."
CBP officer lady: "It was 2011. I did not ask about your sister. Answer the question. How did you keep in touch before her first visit in 2011?"
(After a few iterations, Vishvas understood what she was trying to ask with her imperfect English)
Vishvas: I used to visit India.
CBP officer lady: I suggest you keep doing that. (Then started a lecture) - Her country of residence is not USA. She doesn't have a work permit - you do. (Vishvas tried to interrupt, but was cut off) Don't speak and listen. (Continues lecture.) 6 months visit each time? You're abusing the visa system. Your mother should have been flagged a long time ago....
Vishvas: OK
CBP officer lady: Now tell me - how long is she visiting this time?
Vishvas: 6 months
CBP officer lady: After all my lecture you still say 6 months? She should leave by Jan 15 (15 days away) and stay out for 1 year or she can go back now - change the ticket.
Vishvas: Ok. but I have a request.
CBP officer lady: You have a request? You can make any request, but it won't be granted.
Vishvas: My second child will be delivered this month and the due date is Jan 27. Can she please return by Feb 15?
CBP officer lady: You can deliver how many every babies you want, the delivery date can be anytime. Does not affect immigration. SHe should leave by Jan 15. Don't mess with US immigrations.
Vishvas: Ok.
CBP officer lady: Have a nice visit. (Hangs up)

(Calling nAgarathna over -)
CBP officer lady: ok - you can enter, but leave by jan 15.
Nagarathna: Give me 5 minutes to talk.
CBP officer lady: YOu want to waste 5 more minutes of my time?
Nagarathna: Just want to ask for clarification.
CBP officer lady: ok
Nagarathna: Your country is so vast, shouldn't I visit often?
CBP officer lady: You're not travelling - you're visiting your son. You need other documents for such visits.
Nagarathna: What documents you want?
CBP officer lady: You're not eligible. Don't waste my time.
Nagarathna: Ok, thanks.
(and walks away)

After exiting, Vidya checks I-94 as requested by Vishvas and finds that exit date is 06/29/2019. This date remains constant for the next many days. Nagarathna's visa anyway expires in August. Lest they change the I-94, it was decided not to call CBP for clarification on how long she can stay. 

Ravi's suggestion for next time: Say you're touring east coast. Don't say you're retired, say you're a landlord and maintain properties.
