## निष्कासनादेशः
Respected Sri Vasuki,

Further to our meeting you, later telephone call post that requesting you to clear all illegal construction & vacate the site, please find attached the advisory note from my legal counsel. Kindly make alternate arrangement and vacate from the above said property as per the advisory note.  

We wish you & family the very best.

Respected Mr Vasuki & Smt Vasuki

It was regretful today morning to witness that you have encroached our
property by violating all ownership law and society norms.

You could have simply texted us or messaged on whatsapp seeking a basic
discussion in a conducive & encouraging approach for permission to enter the
gated property, instead you violated the basic rights by encroachment, further
you also constructed structures with concrete block, sheets with two doors
there by violating law beyond any agreeable condition which disrespected all my
ownership rights. You may take into cognisance I did not initiate legal course of
action as you are a senior citizen and a Srivaishnava disciple.
Either ways you are here by advised to dismantle/demolish all

temporary/constructed structures and vacate the property by duly cleaning up
all debris. Also as a humanitarian consideration, you are given one week time
from today to dismantle/clean up and vacate the site by 6pm Friday 26 th
December 2019 without fail.

I presume you exhibit Good Samaritan principle and vacate the premises by the
above mentioned date & time.

We wish you & family the very best,  
Dr Ramanujam & Mrs Rama

## प्रत्युत्तरम्
Dear Dr Ramanujam and Smt Rama Ramanujam,

We are in receipt of your legal notice. You are well within your rights to demand that we vacate. As agreed in our earlier telephone conversation the day before yesterday, we will have removed our temporary shed from your site well before 26th (which is a Thursday and not a Friday).

From your words and actions, we can understand and appreciate your distress and anger at our temporary construction. Since we are not sure that you equally understood our perspective, we would like the attach the below explanation behind our actions.

- We repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to contact smt Rma Ramanujam by phone calls to +91 98455 36129 (this phone number we obtained, after many unsuccessful enquiries from a neighbor who managed to locate it in the final instance). The prospect of sending SMS or whatsapp messaging simply did not occur to us.
- We had happily permitted our neighbor to construct a shed on our site during the construction of his house, and had assumed that there was a good chance that the owner of the vacant site would do us similar courtesy once we finally establish contact (for example, by the owner simply visiting the site and asking what is going on). In fact, this had happened in constructing an older house in another part of Bangalore.
- Our shed, like all contemporary temporary construction sheds, is made of concrete blocks mostly bound together by mud (not concrete) mortar. As such they are easy to dismantle and move. In this way we were anyway prepared for the possibility of the site owner asking us to vacate, if and when contact was established.
- With the view of causing minimum trouble to the neighborhood, as well as for greater convenience in placing building material, we did not want to construct sheds on the road (which we will now have to do). Similarly, despite our best efforts, we have been unable to find out who owns the vacant site next to yours, and have temorarily dumped the mud excavated from our site there. Placing it on the road would have needlessly troubled our neighbors.
- Technically, even walking on a compounded vacant site can be construed as “tresspassing”. And, constructing temporary shed or temporarily storing materials can be called “encroachment”. Still, common sense and magnanimity cause some people not be that harsh.
- Our site is bounded on three sides by elderly Muslim, Christian and Iyer couples. We have benefitted from the goodwill of all of them during our construction so far. In words and deeds, they have helped and cooperated with us in plentiful ways. In similar vein, we appreciate that as a fellow shrIvaishNava, you have done us the courtsey of not calling in police and demolishing our temporary shed :-).

Having thus communicated our perspective, we again reassure you that we will fully comply with your demand. By the grace of sampatkumAra, shrI lakshmI and shrI rAmAnujAchArya, we wish your family well too.

Sincerely,  
Vasuki’s family

अस्योत्तरे रामानुजः - 

Namaskara Mr Vasuki!

Thank you for the response, it doesn't make any sense. Like you mentioned "Allowed" isn't it with a consent based act ? And which did not happen, on the contrary it's encroachment that's committed. 

Give a thought while sipping a cup of coffee, your inner thought will talk the truth.
