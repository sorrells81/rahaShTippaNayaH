## पृष्ठभूमिका
बसवेश्वरनगरगृहम् भाटकाय गृहीत्वा रविर् भ्रातृपरिवारं चॆन्नैनगराद् आनीयास्थापयत्। तदा तस्मिन्नगरे वूहान्महामारी ताण्डवं करोतितरां स्म। कथञ्चित् quarantineविषयं भ्रातृपुत्रमुखाज् ज्ञात्वा राघवादयो भिता - विशिष्य राघवः। 

## राघवाक्षेपः
राघवः - "Request you to please ask everyone of them to vacate the premises and return once the pandemic situation comes under control. ... I have sent the same to Atte as well" 

पितुरनुरोधेन रविना सह भाषितम्। एवञ्जातम् - "just spoke to tenant and told them about your concerns. It seems that children or they have no quarantine seal, and clarified that according to his understanding BBMP will not seal the house anyway. He was very solicitous - and said they were even considering going back to Gulbarga. Asked him and his family to strictly quarantine at home. Children are not to be allowed outside. Washing clothes should also be done inside house only. Both the tenant's sister and brother in law are doctors. I also asked him to talk to you directly. "

राघवस्य तद्वचनेषु विश्वासो नासीत् - "He claimed to go to Hubli and meet his family, later these people came along. He later told that they will stay for a day, but they haven't left still." किन्तु रविस् - "तथा न, मया कार्यान्तरेण तत्र गतमेवेति, भ्रातृमोचनम् आकस्मिकम्" इति चावदत्। 

विश्वासेनैवम् प्रस्तावः कृतः - 
"There are two options now:

- Ensure that he strictly follows 2 weeks self-quarantine.
- Ask him to make other arrangements for the new arrivals.

Assuming that we can trust them to do (option a) properly, do you think it's ok to stay with that? ... How about we check a couple of days and see if they are self-quarantining? When you talk to him, you can make your conditions absolutely clear. "

एवम् बहु प्रयत्नेन प्रस्तुते रविर् नाङ्ग्यकरोत् - भ्रातृपरिवारे गृहे सति नैवं सर्वदा गृह एव भवितुं शक्यम् - प्रातः सायां वा निर्गन्तव्यं स्यात्।

राघवो ऽवदत् - "I spoke to the PA of our corporator, he clearly said if he is not ready to follow quarantine, inform Magadi Road Police, they will help in this situation to evict them. Please let him know this and make alternative arrangements by tomorrow morning, else we will have to take help of them"

तेन रविर् आदाव् ईषद् भीतः। अभयं नटयन्न् पश्चात् सहकर्तुम् प्रारभत। तूर्णं भ्रातृपरिवारम् अन्यत्र स्थापयित्वा ऽऽत्मानं गृहे बध्नामीत्यङ्ग्यकरोत्। विश्वासेन राघवायोक्तम् - "I feel that he might agree and cooperate now. We can make our conditions fully clear - eg. no going out even for milk. Should order on Dunzo, should stay indoors. Then he can choose."

## रविगृहबन्धः
पश्चाच् चर्चयित्वैवम् उक्तम् - "so, your conditions:

- Move brother's family out tomorrow afternoon, expect them to be back on July 1.
- Strictly quarantine yourself till next Sat (conditions to be elaborated)

"

रवय एवम् उक्तम् - "namaste sir, exchanged many messages with rAghav and spoke to him just now. Based on the notices he showed me, it appears that your family got out of TN just in time (starting yesterday, institutional quarantine is mandatory). 
I've negotiated the following:

- They strongly prefer that you quarantine yourself elsewhere along with your borther's family.
- If that is not feasible, you may strictly stay quarantined in your house till Saturday 27th (I convinced him that this will be feasible given that your brother's family will stay elsewhere starting tomorrow afternoon). Strictly meaning no venturing out for any reason - you order any perishables via Dunzo (who will deliver to your doorstep - downstairs folk can help), you store wet/ dry waste (eg. in the back balconey) till the end of quarantine, you will wash and dry clothes inside (no terrace).

I feel that the proposal is sensible (given observations of other people quarantined elsewhere). I urge you to cooperate for everyone's peace of mind. You can relax and think about long term fit later - no hurry. Request your response and confirmation about the path you will choose."

ततः "Expecting him to return alone post his quarantine and test done which proves him to be negative." इति राघवो ऽवदत्। विश्वासस् तु - I think getting him to agree to "- Strictly quarantine yourself till next Sat (conditions to be elaborated)" will be more feasible. Do you think you can force him to quarantine himself eslewhere if he disagrees? इत्यवदत्।

तत एवं निश्चितम् - 

Tenant picked the below choice - he was very cooperative ("Let me make people happy etc.."):
"If that is not feasible, you may strictly stay quarantined in your house till Saturday 27th (I convinced him that this will be feasible given that your brother's family will stay elsewhere starting tomorrow afternoon). Strictly meaning no venturing out for any reason - you order any perishables via Dunzo (who will deliver to your doorstep - downstairs folk can help), you store wet/ dry waste (eg. in the back balconey) till the end of quarantine, you will wash and dry clothes inside (no terrace).
"

राघवः पुनः  - "And if he develops any symptoms, then we and the neighbouring houses will be put under strict sealdown. Why take this unnecessary risk? When he is anyways going to drop them, he might as well stay back and come back as negative" इत्यवदत्।

विश्वासस् तु - "Not happening, rAghav. It is already agreed. There is a limit to how far he will agree to be pushed. Best focus our energies on something more productive."
