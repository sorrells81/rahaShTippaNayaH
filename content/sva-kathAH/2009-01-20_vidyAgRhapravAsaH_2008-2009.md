## विवरणम्
During visit to vidyA and ravi in Seattle: Dec 2008 - Jan 2009: I did not like being blocked access to the bathroom during the night, the fact that my visit was not desired by ravi, my opinions generally not being solicited in planning the day, the humungous waste of my time, having to tag along in many shopping mall trips, the palpable disrespect shown to me by ravi, the irresponsibility in packing/ moving/ travelling to the airport, the late bed time. I liked exposure to the lifestyle of settled and married couples and visits to 2 museums.

During visit to vidyA in Arizona in Dec 2008: I did not like the late bed time and the delay in the travel to the airport; and liked the lively company, glimpses into the lives of the students, road trip to surrounding places.
