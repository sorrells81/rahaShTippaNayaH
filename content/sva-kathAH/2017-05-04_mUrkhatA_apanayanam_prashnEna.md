## विवरणम्
​The purpose of this letter​ is just to thank you. One of the best pieces of advice I ever received was from you in one of our early group meetings where you motivated me to ask any questions I had by saying : "you can ask your question now and expose your ignorance once, or you can remain silent and remain a fool for the rest of your life."

That broke my silence then, and I don't think I hesitated in asking or pursuing a question after that. For some reason, (as it happens), I remembered those very words while rising from bed this morning, and thought to thank you.
