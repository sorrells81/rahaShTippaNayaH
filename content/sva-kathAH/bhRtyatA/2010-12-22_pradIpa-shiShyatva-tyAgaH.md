## विवरणम्
"I had a request about project-allocation. ... I am happy to do experiments, but I also want to build experience in doing analysis. This may have some negative consequences (like slower pace) in the short term; but I am fine with it. Regarding the project you suggest: Even if you say 'you can work with Ali on the theory'; it seems likely that I will end up doing just experimentation.." - इति प्रदीपेन निराकृते,
"... tiny bit of 'explanation': It is important to me that I work at the boundary of my (limited) abilities (by this I do _not_ mean frenzied activity), and in the direction I want. Also, I am not too desperate for a degree and I like to think that I am outside the publish or perish game.
So, I propose the following:
I will take care of my own funding (with or without the department's help), but I want the ultimate freedom to do what I like within your research interests, as long as I make progress which you and the department consider reasonable." इत्यपि निराकरोत्।
