## विवरणम्
GRE was a computer adaptive test. I learned new words using stick-it notes - using sentences/ stories to evoke emotions associated with them.
nAga-naresha's valuable advice: In the last month, do not mug-up words - Just practice the tests in the Big Book (not Computer adaptive). With each test, I did postmortem - "Why did I go wrong on this question? How was I doing on time?" Finally, I took a few computer adaptive tests from CD-s I'd bought. By the final day, I was quite sure about a good score.
Attitude towards TOEFL - not an English test, but a logic test.
Regarding AWA, I wrote only about 3 or 4 practice essays a couple of days before the GRE test. I used to write many essays and harangues  about philosophical and metaphysical topics (in which I was interested for a very long time in the past). So, I did not require much preparation there. Got 1600/1600 5.5/6 in GRE; and top score in TOEFL too.
