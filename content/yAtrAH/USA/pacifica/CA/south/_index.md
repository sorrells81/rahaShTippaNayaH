## Los Angeles Area
- Death Valley National Park		South California	USA	 Drove with an irascible shruti. Scenic viewpoints and drives aplenty, unusual geological formations - surfaces fromed by salt crystals washed down to the basin where two plates meet - one going up and the other under, weird folds; sand dunes farther away. Long empty roads, clear skies.			Jan 2012.
- Disneyland		South California	USA	 vismaya at kalpanA-shakti of the cartoonists, mechanical puppetry (life-like Abraham Lincoln gave a speech, the Honda ASIMO robot), projection techniques using which 3D images were projected on what appeared to be dust in the air, rides set to familiar music.			July 2011.
- Universal studios		South California	USA	
  - Excellent 3-D shows - even with seats equipped with vibrators, pipes which blew spray and hot air Eg  Shrek 4D. Terminator, a ride through Godzilla vs T-Rex land projected in 3D on a rotating screen. 
  - An excellent studio-tour where sets from famous movies and TV shows were shown along with nice physical special effects like cars which appear to move through the air, recreated earthquakes, flash floods. A show which explained how special effects are done  both using computer generated background imanges and mesh-animated people. Nice show by the Blues Brothers and recreation of some Waterworld stunts.
