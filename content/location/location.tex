Off campus employment is still available in cases of severe economic hardship.
Employment authorization may be available under the curricular practical training program if the proposed employment is an integral or important part of curriculum. Where employment is required for a graduate degree, employment may begin right away.

-------------------------------------
Dual intent is a United States immigration law concept. It refers to the concept that certain visitors may be temporarily present in the USA while acting in a manner that later leads to obtaining lawful permanent residence (green cards).
Persons with H-1B visas (for specialty workers), O-1 visas (for workers who have extraordinary ability), L-1 visas (for corporate transferrees), K visas (for fiancees/spouses/minor children of U.S. citizens) and V visas (for spouses/minor children of lawful permanent residents) are generally allowed dual intent.
The rule states that someone who acts in a manner to change status within 30 days is presumed to have had immigrant intent and if they act within 60 days of entry the authorities can be suspicious of the alien's fraud upon their original application.
-------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{OPT}
OPT status holders have to pay Federal and State taxes like H1B Visa holders but unlike them OPT people need not pay Social Security and Medicare taxes.

\section{Employment visas}
\begin{verbatim}

O-1
----------
Eligibility:
The O-1 classification is a type of employment visa under United States immigration law that applies to aliens who have extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and who are coming temporarily to the U.S. to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability.
----------
-------------------------------------
H1B
----------
Eligibility:
The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa category provided for in the Immigration & Nationality Act, section 101(a)(15)(H) that allows American companies and universities to temporarily employ foreign workers who have the equivalent to a US Bachelor's Degree.
A specialty occupation is one that requires theoretical and practical application of a body of specialized knowledge along with at least a bachelor�s degree or its equivalent. For example, architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the arts may be considered to be specialty occupations.
For every H-1B petition filed with the USCIS, there must be included a Labor Condition Application (LCA) certified by the U.S. Department of Labor. The LCA is designed to ensure that the wage offered to the non-immigrant worker must meet or exceed the prevailing wage in the area of employment. With PERM, labor certification processing times have been reduced to less than 90 days.
----------
Responsibilities
H-1B workers are legally required to pay the same taxes as any other US resident, including Social Security and Medicare.[2] Any person who spends more than 183 days in the US in a calendar year is a tax resident and is required to pay US taxes on their worldwide income. H-1B workers pay higher taxes than a US citizen because they are not entitled to certain deductions.
----------
Constraints:
The number of new H-1Bs issued each year in the United States is subject to an annual congressionally-mandated quota. Those beneficiaries not subject to the annual quota are those who currently hold H-1B status or have held H-1B status at some point in the past six years and have not been outside the United States for more than 365 consecutive days. In 2000, Congress permanently exempted H-1B visas going to Universities and Government Research Laboratories from the quota. (Nota Bene) The basic quota was left at 65,000 but with an additional 20,000 visas possible for foreign workers with US advanced degrees. A tiny country like Barbados has the same quota as India or China. Dependents of employment-based applicants count against the annual, per-country visa numbers cap.
H-1B aliens may only work for the petitioning U.S. employer and only in the H-1B activities described in the petition.
In the instance that the applicant loses his/her job they have to leave the country within 14 days.
Some recent state regulations prohibit H-4 visa holders from obtaining a driver's license in cases where driver's licenses are no longer being issued on Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers alone and an SSN is required.
In theory, the maximum duration of the H-1B visa is six years (ten years for exceptional Defense Department project-related work).
There are generally two exceptions to the 6 year duration of the H-1B visa:
    If a visa holder has submitted an I-140 immigrant petition or a labor certification prior to his 5th year anniversary of having the H-1B visa, he is entitled to renew his H-1B visa in 1 year increments until a decision has been rendered on his application for permanent residence.
    If the visa holder has an approved I-140 immigrant petition, but is unable to initiate the final step of the green card process due to his priority date not being current, he may be entitled to a 3 year extension of his H-1B visa.
----------
Rights:
H-1B visa holders are allowed to bring their immediate family members (spouse and children under 21) to the United States under H4 Visa category as dependents. A H4 Visa holder may attend school, obtain a driver's license and open a bank account while in the US.
-------------------------------------
L-1 visa
----------
Eligibility:
It is a nonimmigrant visa, and is valid for a relatively short amount of time - generally two years. L-1 visas are available to employees of an international company with offices in both a home country and the United States, or which intend to open a new office in the United States while maintaining their home country interests.
Application for an L-1 visa begins with the filing of a petition with the U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) on Form I-129
The L-1 visa has two subcategories: L-1A for executives and managers, and L-1B for workers with specialized knowledge. L-1A status is valid for up to seven years; L-1B status is good for up to five years.
----------
Constraints:
After the expiration of the seven or five years, respectively, the alien must leave the United States for an aggregate of 365 days.
There are two types of L-1 procedures:
    * Regular L-1 visas, which must be applied for and approved for each individual by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS); and
    * Blanket L-1 visas which are available to employers who hire large numbers of Intracompany Transferees every year.
For Canadian residents, a special L visa category is available. E-3 visas are issued to citizens of Australia under the Australia free-trade treaty. H-1B1 visas are issued to residents of Chile and Singapore under the amended NAFTA treaty.

----------
Rights:
Spouses of L-1 visa holders are allowed to work, without restriction, in the US, and the L-1 visa may legally be used as a steppingstone to the Green Card under the doctrine of dual intent.
Upon application at the consulate or embassy, the spouse and children of the primary applicant who are under the age of 21 may be issued L-2 visas.
-------------------------------------
K-1 visa
----------
Eligibility:
A K-1 visa is a United States nonimmigrant visa benefitting fianc�s and fianc�es of US citizen petitioners.
The Embassy will contact the fiancee and schedule an interview date. In the meantime, the fiancee has to have a medical examination at an approved clinic, to screen for certain infectious diseases like HIV and TB. The Embassy staff will question the fiancee and ask for additional documents.
The fianc�(e) then has six months to enter the US, and 90 days after that to marry the Petitioner.
----------
Constraints:
The average wait from initial filing to a Consular interview is 181 days.
K1 visa may not be issued to a recent student visitor (to discourage foreigners being students merely for the purpose of meeting US spouses).
\end{verbatim}
-------------------------------------
\section{Permanent Residence (Green Card)}
----------
\begin{verbatim}
Eligibility:
In the first step, USCIS approves the immigrant petition by a qualifying relative, an employer, or in rare cases such as with an investor visa, the applicant. If a sibling is applying, it must be a nuclear relative with the same parents as the applicant. Second, unless the applicant is an "immediate relative", an immigrant visa number through the State Department must be available. This number might not be immediately available even if the USCIS approves the petition because the amount of immigrant visa numbers is limited every year. There are also certain additional limitations by country. Finally, when an immigrant visa number is available, the applicant must apply with USCIS to adjust their current status to permanent resident status.
---
FAMILY SPONSORED
IR Immediate relative (spouses, minor children & parents) of US citizens. [No numerical limit]
Unmarried sons and daughters (21 years of age or older) of US citizens [23,400     6-7 years]
Spouses and minor children (under 21 year old) of lawful permanent residents [87,934 5-6 years]
Unmarried sons and daughters (21 years of age or older) of lawful permanent residents [26,266 9-10 years]
Married sons and daughters of US citizens [23,400 8-9 years]
Brothers and sisters of adult US citizens [65,000 10-11 years]

After marrying, an "Adjustment of Status" (using a USCIS form I-485[2]) must be filed that will convert the K1 fiancee and K2 children status to that of "Conditional Lawful Permanent Resident Status".
The Conditional Permanent Resident Card can be converted just before the two year anniversy of the issuance of the conditional Greencard to unconditional status by making another application and attending a second Interview. If however, the couple has split up and a history of spousal abuse can be documented to the USCIS, the fiancee alone can apply for the uncoditional status if it can be shown the separation or divorce was the fault of the Petitioner.
---
EMPLOYMENT BASED
EB1 Priority workers -- persons with extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or outstanding professors and researchers [40,000     Currently available].
EB2 Professionals holding advanced degrees (Ph.D., master's degree, or at least 5 years of progressive post-baccalaureate experience) or persons of exceptional ability in sciences, arts, or business[40,000     Currently available] Zhendong Lu used this route to get a green card.
EB3 Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers [40,000     4-5 years]
Certain special immigrants -- ministers, religious workers, current or former US government workers, etc. [10,000     Currently available]
Investors [10,000     Currently available]

The employer must legally 'prove' that it has a need to hire for a specific position and that there are no qualified U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident available to fill that position. For highly skilled foreign nationals (EB1 and EB2 National Interest Waiver) and "Schedule A" labor[4] (nurses and physical therapists), this step is waived.
Immigrant visa petition. The employer applies on the alien's behalf to obtain a visa number. The application is called the I-140 form and is processed by the USCIS. Currently, this process takes up to 6 months.
After the labor certification, the alien has a choice to finalize the green card via consular processing or adjustment of status.
After the process is complete, the alien is expected to take the certified job offered by the employer to substantiate his or her immigrant status.
