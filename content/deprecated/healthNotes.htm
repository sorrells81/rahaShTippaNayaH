    <li>Sedentary lifestyle is a major underlying cause of
death, disease, and disability. [<a href="http://www.who.int/moveforhealth/advocacy/information_sheets/sedentary/en/index.html">Ref</a>]
It is characterized by sitting or remaining inactive for most of the
day. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary">Ref</a>]<br>

continuously seated/ sedentary lifestyle.</small></li>





    <li>A 2005 study published in the Journal of Applied
Physiology found that after just two weeks of interval training, six of
the eight college-age men and women doubled their endurance, or the
amount of time they could ride a bicycle at moderate intensity before
exhaustion. Researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario,
had the exercisers sprint for 30 seconds, then either stop or pedal
gently for four minutes. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/fashion/03Fitness.html?ex=1335844800&amp;en=48386e6eb3181b11&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">

    <li>Researchers from the University of Michigan discovered that a session
of aerobic exercise increases storage of fat in muscle, which actually
improves insulin sensitivity. (Insulin resistance is an important part of Type-2 diabetes.) [<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070614170302.htm">Ref</a>]</li>

    <li>The findings, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in
1992, reported that the least frequent vacationers (those who took no
more than one vacation every six years) were at 50% higher risk for a
heart attack than the most frequent vacationers (those who took at
least two vacations every year). [<a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-vacation16jul16,0,6033132,full.story?coll=la-home-middleright">Ref</a>]</li>





    <li>People who took an afternoon nap of 30 minutes or more at

    <li>But in winter months at latitudes of 52 degrees north (above
Birmingham), there is no ultraviolet light of the appropriate
wavelength for the body to make vitamin D in the skin, research shows. [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7161458.stm">Ref</a>]</li>

    <li>A study published in the Brigham and Women's Hospital
Journal revealed that slashing salt consumption reduces the risk of
heart disease. <a href="http://www.biopeer.com/biopeer/2007/04/nutritional_res.html">
[Ref]</a></li>






























    <li>Vitamins, minerals, antioxidants:</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>People over 50 years of age can benefit from B12
supplementation because absorption of this vitamin in the digestive
tract becomes less efficient with age, says Roberta Anding, spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Association. However, a major problem with
supplements is that they deliver vitamins out of context. <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa011&amp;ref=feedburner&amp;articleId=96D80253-E7F2-99DF-326CCCAF57732EFE">[Ref]</a></li>





    <li>A four-year clinical trial involving 1,200 women found
those taking the vitamin D had about a 60-per-cent reduction in cancer
incidence, compared with those who didn't take it, a drop so large --
twice the impact on cancer attributed to smoking. ... The recommended UV exposure is 15
minutes on the face and arms with the sun high in the sky twice a week.
      <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2007/04/cancer_its_all_about_vitamin_d.php">[Ref]</a></li>





    <li>Researchers found high dietary folate was linked to lower levels of sperm with the wrong number of chromosomes.&nbsp;
Folate, also protective against birth defects, is found in leafy green vegetables, fruit and pulses. [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7303375.stm">Ref</a>]</li>

    <li>Cilantro is useful in chelation. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation_therapy">Ref</a>]</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>






























    <li>One review found that mortality from coronary heart
disease was
24% lower in vegetarians than in nonvegetarians. Studies of cancer have
not shown clear differences in cancer rates between vegetarians and
non-vegetarians. There is evidence that vegetarians tend to have a
lower body mass index, lower risk of obesity, lower blood cholesterol
levels, lower homocysteine levels, lower risk of high blood pressure,
and lower risk of type 2 diabetes. One large prospective study found
that non-meat-eaters had only half the risk of meat eaters of requiring
an emergency appendectomy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_nutrition">[Ref]</a></li>






  <li>Low cancer diet:</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>The WCRF/AICR Expert Report lists 10 recommendations that people can
follow to help reduce their risk of developing cancer, including the
following dietary guidelines: (1) reducing intake of foods and drinks
that promote weight gain, namely energy-dense foods and sugary drinks,
(2) eating mostly foods of plant origin, (3) limiting intake of red
meat and avoiding processed meat, (4) limiting consumption of alcoholic
beverages, and (5) reducing intake of salt and avoiding mouldy cereals
(grains) or pulses (legumes). [<a href="http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/?p=recommendations">Ref</a>]&nbsp;A study of 26,000 Greek people found just using more olive oil alone cut the risk by 9%. [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7483164.stm">Ref</a>]</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>













    <li>Cooking and food combination:</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>Water-soluble nutrients like vitamins C and B and a group of
nutrients called polyphenolics are often lost in
processing.&nbsp;Fat-soluble compounds like vitamins A, D, E and K and
the antioxidant compounds called <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/nutrition/vitamin-a/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Vitamin A.">carotenoids</a>
are less likely to leach out in water. Cooking also breaks down the
thick cell walls of plants, releasing the contents for the body to use.
That is why processed tomato products have higher lycopene content than
fresh tomatoes.&nbsp;In January, a report in The Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry
concluded that over all, boiling was better for carrots, zucchini and
broccoli than steaming, frying or serving them raw. Frying was by far
the worst. Steaming and boiling caused a 22 percent to 34 percent loss of vitamin
C. Microwaved and pressure-cooked vegetables retained 90 percent of
their vitamin C. [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/health/nutrition/20well.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin">Ref</a>]</li>





    <li>When the salsa or salad was served with fat-rich avocados or full-fat
salad dressing, the diners absorbed as much as 4 times more lycopene, 7
times more lutein and 18 times the beta carotene than those who had
their vegetables plain or with low-fat dressing. [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/health/nutrition/20well.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin">Ref</a>]</li>





    <li>It may seem hard to believe, but microwaving is one of the two best
ways to cook veggies and retain the nutrients inside. (Steaming is the
other.) Cooking methods like baking or grilling that expose foods to
higher temperatures and more cooking time are much more destructive.
... whenever vegetables are immersed in cooking liquid, water-soluble
nutrients such as folic acid and vitamin C leach out of the food and
into the surrounding liquid. To keep the nutrients intact when
microwaving, you need only a couple of tablespoons of water to cook raw
vegetables; frozen ones need no extra liquid at all. [<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/123325">Ref</a>]</li>





    <li>E. coli 0157 on
fresh produce can be killed by heating at 160 F for at least 15
seconds.&nbsp;So far, frozen spinach appears to be safe. It's been cooked,
and is often cooked again after thawing. [<a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1538780,00.html">Ref</a>]</li>

    <li>Brown rice is more nutritious than white rice. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rice">Ref</a>]</li>





    <li>In a Harvard study of over 40,000 male health professionals, researchers 
        found that a high total dietary fiber intake was linked to a 40 percent 
        lower risk of coronary heart disease, compared to a low fiber intake. [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=8627965">JAMA</a>]</li>

  <li>Recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial" title="Clinical trial">clinical trials</a> have found that consumption of various nuts such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond" title="Almond">almonds</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut" title="Walnut">walnuts</a> can lower serum <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDL" class="mw-redirect" title="LDL">LDL</a> cholesterol concentrations.

  <li>Non plant nutrients:</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>Eggs have a bad reputation because of their high cholesterol content:
210 milligrams in the yolk of a large egg. ... Eating three eggs a day for 30 days increased cholesterol in
susceptible people, but their LDL particles were larger, and there was
no change in the ratio between LDL and HDL, which suggests no major
change in coronary risk. More significantly, eggs do not appear to contribute to heart disease
in most people. A pivotal study from Harvard in 1999, of nearly 120,000
men and women, found no association between eggs&#8212;up to one a day&#8212;and
heart disease, except in people with diabetes. Nor did it find a link
between eggs and strokes. ... Most people can eat one or two a day. Just don&#8217;t mess them up by
preparing them with fatty, salty ingredients or serving them with
unhealthy side dishes.

    <li>Nutrients deficient in many plant products include some
essential amino acids, some essential fatty acids (especially Omega 3),
Calcium, Vitamin B-12, Vitamin D, Iron and Zinc. Hence, a balanced diet
can comprise of leafy vegetables, cereals, nuts, fruits, dairy products
and egg. Variety is important.<br>

  <li>According to<a href="http://thegreenguide.com/"> The Green Guide</a>, a
website and magazine devoted to greener living and owned by the
National Geographic Society, the safest plastics for repeated use in
storing food are made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE, or plastic

    <li>Some of its food storage containers use polycarbonate (plastic
#7),
which has been shown to leach the harmful hormone-disrupting chemical
Bisphenol A (BPA) into food items after repeated uses. Beyond BPA,
other chemicals can be found in various food storage
containers. Containers made out of polyethylene terephthalate (PET or
PETE, or plastic #1)&#8212;such as most soda bottles&#8212;are OK to use once, but
can leach carcinogenic, hormone-disrupting phthalates when used over
and over again. ... Also, many deli items come wrapped in plastic made
from polyvinyl
chloride (PVC, or plastic #3), which can leach cancer-causing dioxins.
Containers made of polystyrene (PS, or plastic #6, also known as
Styrofoam) can also be dangerous, as its base component, styrene, has
been associated with skin, eye and respiratory irritation, depression,
fatigue, compromised kidney function, and central nervous system
damage. [<a href="http://www.popsci.com/earthtalk/article/2008-08/how-safe-tupperware">Ref</a>]</li>

(fat concentrated around the waist in relation to abdominal organs, and
not subcutaneous fat, it seems) is known to predispose individuals for
insulin resistance, possibly due to its secretion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine" title="Adipokine">adipokines</a> (a group of hormones) that impair glucose tolerance. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2">Ref</a>]</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Many Asian people, particularly South Asians, are also more prone to
abdominal obesity, the study noted. Skinny people with thick middles
are particularly prone to developing Type II Diabetes, which helps
explain why the disease is spreading in places where people are, on
average, quite thin. [<a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1902100,00.html?xid=rss-world">Ref</a>]</li>

    <li>About 6,000 middle-aged or older women in the UK develop cancer
each year because they are obese or overweight, a Cancer Research
UK-funded study says. [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7079799.stm">Ref</a>]&nbsp;Obesity
leads to high levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in
the circulation: theoretically, this could protect early-stage cancer
cells scattered throughout the body from dying, since insulin-like
growth factor inhibits the action of cell suicide genes. ... Fat cells
release inflammatory chemicals into the circulation that can stimulate
the growth of cancer cells. [<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/141495/page/3">Ref</a>] A study by the <a title="American Cancer Society" href="http://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=American+Cancer+Society" class="related">American Cancer Society</a>

had a significantly increased risk of death from 10 different kinds of
cancer in men, and from 12 different kinds in women. The most extreme
examples were liver cancer in men (nearly fivefold increased risk) and
uterine cancer in women (more than sixfold increased risk). [<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/141495/page/1">Ref</a>]</li>
