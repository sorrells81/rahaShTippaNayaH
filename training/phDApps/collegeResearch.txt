PhD: Dec. 13 - with aid
MS: Dec. 13 - no aid
Combination MS/PhD not offered.
MS program emphasises both breadth and depth. that is 45 credits. plus, there is distinction in research available.
Interesting concentrations offered: Artificial Intelligence (has apps in bioInf), Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computation (lots of modelling)
Student profile: 
They come from common colleges. IIIT-A, SJCE, RV etc.. They are after undergrads with distiction in college!! Everyone has Manjuesque profiles. Academic honors are high on their resumes. Rashmi Raj has a profile similar to mine. She too has many honors. E ch year approximately 1,500 applications are received for our graduate programs. It is recommended that all parts of the application be strong as many outstanding applications are received.
Other information:
SOP must be in TEXT format and NOT EXCEED ONE FULL PAGE (4000 letters.) Emphasize "MS degree with distinction in research" and manju's info in it.

PhD: Dec. 13 - with aid
MS: Dec. 13 - no aid
Supplemental forms at http://www.bmi.stanford.edu. MCAT
accepted in lieu of GRE for U.S. physics or medical students.
Target degree: Academic M.S.

Funding:
it is difficult to fund Academic M.S. candidates who do not already possess an M.D. or Ph.D.
Candidates are usually not admitted to the Academic M.S. and Ph.D. programs unless funding can be established.
These negatives put this out of the question.
Departments of CS, Genetics offer bioinf courses too. But Genetics department is looking only for Biology admissions.
-------------------------------
Conclusion: too picky. too popular. too much emphasis on academic honors. will not apply.

Supporting data, such as transcripts, recommendation letters, and GRE and TOEFL scores, should arrive no later than January 9, 2007
Student body;
Includes Indians. Hard to determine MS backgrounds, though. But going by the MS/ PhD profiles, it seems replete with IIT's with great academic honors and atleast one publication.

 Deadline for all applications to be considered for admission and departmental support 	January 5
Student body:
includes those with BS Computer Engineering & Mathematics. Includes Indians. Hard to determine MS backgrounds, though. 
-------------------------------
Vision Science seems too narrow. Computer Science seems too competetive (partially because it is a public university). It is indeed harder than stanford. No decision yet. This seems to be a hopeless case. But IISc may change that. Will take recco for this from Venu in their format. can only apply to one.

This area involves research and study in computer architecture, computer systems and networks, theory and design of digital systems, and software engineering. Investigations include architecture design, parallel processing, neural networks, microprocessor-based systems, fault-tolerant computing, design for testability, computer-aided design, computer vision, VLSI system design, embedded systems, local area networks, and hardware/software codesign.
Seems arcane and insipid.
The deadline for Summer 2007, Fall 2007, and Spring 2008 is January 17, 2007. 
he Department has limited funding for financial assistance, particularly for newly admitted international students. Only a few of the most exceptional applicants are offered an award prior to enrolling in ECE. The large number of highly qualified applicants makes fellowship awards extremely competitive. Fellowships are awarded primarily in the Fall semester, and some awards may include an offer of a Teaching Assistantship as well.

Applicants should have an undergraduate degree in a natural science, computer science, or engineering. They should show evidence of strong quantitative skills and of serious interest in the life sciences.
The M.S. degree (thesis option) 
As of Fall 2006, we expect to support all admitted students with a combination of department teaching assistantships and fellowships, as well as research assistantships from affiliated faculty.
"In addition, we look for evidence of outstanding motivation, especially in interdisciplinary studies with a record of successful experimental or other experience outside the classroom. Ideally, engineers would have a minor in biology.  For students of outstanding potential, however, remediation outside of their main discipline can be accomplished as part of graduate training. "
International applicants must submit evidence that they have sufficient financial support for the length of their graduate study program and should also submit rank in class information.

CSE: http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/grad/prospective.html
Deadline to apply for admission each Autumn Quarter is  December 15. International documents take longer to process so we recommend international students to meet the earlier deadline if possible.
The department has roughly 150 students in the full-time graduate program. We typically award fifteen Ph.D. degrees and twenty-five Masters degrees each year. The department requires applicants to use the on-line application to the Graduate School and to Computer Science & Engineering. 
An official score report for the TSE (taken within the last 2 years) is required of all international applicants. "However, we are delaying the requirement for students who attended secondary or post-secondary schools that offered instruction mainly in English" "Students who attended these types of schools may delay taking the TSE until they are accepted and arrive here at the UW."
"We strongly prefer that letters of recommendation be submitted online. If this is not possible, you may mail hard copies to the address listed above."
Once admitted, a student may choose to pursue only a masters degree, but this is the student's choice, not that of the admission committee. We ignore whether a student indicates M.S. or Ph.D., and consider all applicants with Ph.D. criteria in mind. 
Computational Molecular Biology Group actively exists.

Due to the time required for evaluation of applications, overseas applicants for Autumn quarter are strongly encouraged to submit the application and transcripts to the Office of Graduate Admissions no later than the prior November 1. 
Admission to the Department of Applied Mathematics is competitive, with less than 10% admitted to study leading to a Ph.D. degree from the pool of applicants satisfying the minimum requirements of the Graduate School. The admission standard for a (terminal) professional M.Sc. degree is not as high and is based on our evaluation of the applicants' ability to complete the course work required for the M.Sc. degree.
Departmental fundi g available for the first year of study. Both research and teaching assistantships are available to full-time students who qualify. In addition, fellowship funds for the study of applied mathematics are available and awarded on a competitive basis. Students interested in financial aid should fill out the Assistantship and Fellowship application and return it with their application for admission. This aid is merit based only. 
All international and immigrant status applicants who intend to apply for teaching assistantships must also take the Test of Spoken English (TSE) and achieve a score of 55 or better.

The M.Eng. program is a professional degree p ogram, aimed at enhancing your practical skills in computer science.
this makes it uninteresting.

Unfortunately, UCLA has only a limited number of fellowships and assistantships for which non-U.S. graduate students are eligible. These are awarded to students who have demonstrated high academic achievement in their studies on this campus. International students at UCLA are not eligible for support based solely on need (loans and work-study jobs). Therefore, international students are strongly advised to secure funds from their own sources.

Bass 432A, 432.8189
M.S. en route to Ph.D.
Applicants are expected 
(1) to have a strong foundation in the basic sciences, such as biology, chemistry, and mathematics, and 
(2) to have training in computing/informatics, including significant computer programming experience. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test is required, and the GRE Subject Test in cell and molecular biology, biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, or other relevant discipline is recommended. 
This seems quite hopeless.. but probably a good idea to apply.
"The BBS Program is intended only for students pursuing a doctoral degree. Computational Biology and Bioinformatics does offer a Terminal Masters degree, but this degree program is separate from and unaffiliated with BBS. "
 Financial aid for students who are neither U.S. citizens nor U.S. permanent residents is very limited. Although approximately 20% of each entering class is international, on average, we are able to admit less than 5% of our non-U.S. applicant pool.
Yale has an interdepartmental CBB PhD program.

Master of Science in Engineering Program:
To be considered for admission, students must hold a bachelor's degree in engineering.
The funding included in this package is as follows: 50% tuition is awarded by the G.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering; 30% tuition is awarded for a mandatory teaching assistantship; and additional funding is typically obtained by working on a funded project as a research assistant. University faculty and laboratories sponsor a number of research projects that pay research assistant stipends and fund the remaining 20% tuition. 
Students include 4 indians. Only email addresses are available at http://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/graduatestudents.php.
I count around 60 MSE students.
bioinformatics research at bme seems more organised when compared to cs.

also.  The only other thing that I can suggest is that you email a scanned

i have asked: I am a computer science graduate. I have excellant scores in the GRE
General Test and in TOEFL. But, I have not written the Computer
Science subject test. Will my application be considered? (I am very
keen to apply.)
gradstudy at cs.rutgers.edu: 
That said, we do review all applications, even incomplete ones. We will not
automatically reject you without the CS GRE score. Instead we will ask
whether your application is strong enough to stand on its own no matter what
your score might have been on the CS subject test.

Good at bioinformatics, according to anshul and sarvagya
Funding for students who are accepted into an MMath or PhD program is typically a combination of teaching assistantships and research assistantships. An MMath student receiving full support from TA and RA currently receives $21,678 per year; a PhD student currently receives $23,627 per year. International students receive additional financial support to make up the additional cost for tuition fees for international students.
Currently, nearly 100% of our full-time MMath graduate students and PhD graduate students are fully funded. An MMath student receiving full support from TA and RA currently receives $21,678 per year;

I am very interested in the inter-disciplinary aspects of computer science research. In fact, I hope to build my research career in an area where computer science meets the life sciences. 

Biology, which hitherto had been a mostly descriptive science is shaping into a predictive science. I think that Computer Science can be used to make significant discoveries in this aspect of biology. 

I am very happy to find that "Biological Modeling and Visualization" is an active research area at the University of Calagry. The work by the BMV group led by Professor Prusinkiewicz is startlingly original and inspiring, and I would be privileged to be a part of this unique group. 

I am equally glad to see that Dr. Christian Jacob is interested in simulation, and visualization of biological systems. Making discoveries in biology through the use of computer science (computational biology) and discovering algorithms inspired by biological systems (bioinformatics) are complementary. I would consider myself privileged to be part of this deep research, which has such excellant potential for fundamental breakthroughs in momentous problems.

Hence, considering my interests, I hope to be supervised either by Dr. Christian Jacob, or by Professor Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz.

Research Experience:
Nov 2006 to present: 	Project Assistant, ECE Department, Indian Institute of Science: 
In this project, which is funded by the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, we investigate the use of wireless sensor networks in detecting, classifying and tracking various objects. My role is to evaluate various sensing algorithms by implementing them with a set of motes, and to evaluate tamper-resistance of various types of motes. 
Professional Experience:
Feb 2006 to Aug 2006:	Software Development Engineer, Windows Group, Microsoft: 
We built a Java terminal services client. Starting from scratch, we delivered the product in six months. I developed and owned various modules of this project.
Jul 2003 to Dec 2004:	Software Engineer, Product Lifecycle Management Group, Infosys: 
From Jul 2003 to Mar 2004, we produced a new version of Ematrix's Product Central. 
From Apr 2004 to Dec 2004, we built a machine-part management system for use by Porsche. 
In these projects, I implemented fresh features, fixed bugs, did some testing, produced technical documentation, maintained the bug-tracking (bugzilla) portal, made UI mock-ups, participated in design, and reviewed code. Significant self-driven initiatives during this time included writing software for bug-notification, synchronizing bug databases and ranking employees based on minimal input.
Feb 2003 to Jul 2003:	Project Trainee, Satyam Computer Services Ltd.: 
I wrote a performance intensive spreadsheet software using VB which worked with both XML and Excel formats. This software also prevented cyclical reference of cells in arithmetic formulae.
