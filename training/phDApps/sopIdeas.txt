guidelines:
The statement of purpose should describe succintly your reasons for applying to the proposed program at university U, your preparation for this field of study, your study and research interests, future career plans, and other aspects of your background and interests which may aid the admissions committee in evaluating your aptitude and motivation for graduate study.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
tips from http://www.cs.umd.edu/~arun/grad/sop.html :
 Avoid hot air. Adjectives like thrill, passion, excitement, joy, etc., should be avoided like the plague. 
 Avoid quotations. You may have "miles to go before you sleep"
 Describe your coursework tersely. 
 Explain a select few projects you did in gory detail and why that got you interested in research. This is a point of much debate. 
 Say how you, Prof.Foo, and Prof.Bar can attain the holy grail of networking together. You should appear in awe of them, yet, appear indispensable to their work. Avoid mentioning persons alone, i.e., qualify a professor by the group he leads/is part of. 

tips from wisc:
As a general rule, overly enthusiastic letters expressing very long term objectives and opinions tend to be discounted. A short, specific letter that is backed by other elements of the application is most effective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
reasons for applying to the proposed program at university U:
university U is well known.
department D is well known.
The program suits my intersts.

your study and research interests:
Computer science, because of my training. Specifically, I am particularly excited about bioinformatics and compuational biology. Both are complimentary. Computational biology offers a unique chance to apply computer science to make discoveries in Biology, whereas Bioinformatics involves making discoveries in Computer Science inspired by biology problems. I am also thrilled by the prospect of impacting the chances of survival of the human species through my contributions to science in a way industrial work can't. AI's may be applied in computational biology.

your preparation for this field of study:
my BE course.
work in the industry, both at Infosys (a software services sector company) and at Microsoft (a product R & D company.)
my interest in CS research was turned on by work i was doing, and by my colleagues, alumni of excellant academia.
The research assistantships, contacts with universities. Strong pre-university biology education.

future career plans:
Obtain a PhD, become a professor, research and discover in the field of my interest. This is inline with my ultimate goal to participate in science so as to impact the prospects of humanity positively.

other aspects of your background and interests which may aid the admissions committee in evaluating your aptitude and motivation for graduate study:
My determined GRE and TOEFL effort: wonderful results in the midst of a challenging and hectic job.
leaving the handsome salary at Microsoft to enter academia in order to prepare for my graduate studies.
Previous record of strong and determined work in pursuit of project goals. 
Pursued philosophy like mad.

Conclusion:
i am determined. I hope to have proved my interests, ability and determination in realizing those intersts. I look forward to your positive response.
